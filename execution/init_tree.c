//Pipes (|) are processed left-to-right (send output from left to right).
//Heredoc (<<) typically applies to the right-hand command,
//cmd1 | cmd2 << heredoc, here, cmd1 writes its output to cmd2 by the pipe.
//and The heredoc provides data to cmd2
//In (AST), cmd1 is on the left side of the tree (because it's executed first)
//and cmd2 is on the right (because it receives data from cmd1)
//When there's heredoc, it affects the right side (i.e., cmd2).
//So the tree processes the right-hand side when the heredoc isn't initialized
//to ensure that cmd2 properly receives input from the heredoc 
//INSTEAD OF from cmd1's pipe.
//while itâ€™s not mandatory to place the command affected by heredoc on the right
//the design conventionally puts it there for consistency with other operators.
//so if heredoc_siginit is not initialized, we do it
